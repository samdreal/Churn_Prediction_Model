# Predictive Customer Churn Analysis Using Machine Learning, Power BI, and SQL

This project involves an end-to-end analysis of customer churn using SQL Server for data preparation, Power BI for visualization, and a Random Forest machine learning model for prediction. Below are the key steps involved in this project:

## 1. ETL Process in SQL Server
Extract: Gather data from various sources (e.g., databases, CSV files).
Transform: Clean and preprocess the data, including normalization and aggregations.
Load: Insert the transformed data into the target SQL Server database.

## 2. Data Cleaning in SQL Server
Identify and Handle Missing Values: Address any null or missing values in the dataset.
Remove Duplicates: Ensure there are no duplicate records in the data.
Correct Data Types: Convert data types as needed for accurate analysis and processing.

## 3. Power BI Transformations
Data Import: Import the cleaned data from SQL Server into Power BI.
Data Shaping: Perform additional data transformations and reshaping within Power BI to prepare for analysis.

## 4. Power BI Visualization & Enhancing Visuals
Create Visualizations: Develop various charts and graphs to represent the data effectively.
Enhance Dashboards: Apply formatting, add interactivity, and optimize visuals for better insights and user experience.

## 5. Build Machine Learning Model - Random Forest in Jupyter Notebook
Model Development: Build and train a Random Forest model using Python and the scikit-learn library in a Jupyter Notebook.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## 6. Visualize Predicted Data in Power BI - Predicted Churner Profile
Import Predictions: Import the churn predictions from the Random Forest model into Power BI.
Create Visuals for Predictions: Develop visualizations that highlight the predicted churn profiles and insights.
